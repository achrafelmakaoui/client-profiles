              "whyDescription": "Sopetrole faced a challenge: only 13% of taxi fuel transactions were made at their stations. To increase this share, a loyalty program was implemented, incentivizing taxi drivers with redeemable points for purchases at station shops. Additionally, the system enhances security by detecting fraudulent transactions using Google Cloud Vision OCR. To further improve efficiency, a QR code scanning system was integrated, allowing pompists to add transactions quickly without manual input.",

              "keyFeatures": "The system includes a Taxi Driver Loyalty Program, allowing drivers to earn points for refueling, which can be redeemed at station shops. To ensure transaction security, fraud detection is implemented using OCR and AI for real-time validation. Dynamic dashboards powered by Power BI provide real-time insights into fuel sales. Additionally, the admin management system enables the addition, updating, and deletion of taxi drivers, supervisors, pompists, and shop supervisors. To streamline operations, a QR code scanning feature allows pompists to quickly register transactions, minimizing manual input time and improving efficiency.",
              "role": "I was responsible for full-stack development, building both the React.js frontend and the Express.js + FastAPI backend. I implemented Google Cloud Vision OCR for fraud detection, integrated Power BI dashboards, designed the MongoDB Atlas database structure, and developed functionalities for managing taxi drivers, supervisors, pompists, and shop supervisors. Additionally, I implemented a QR code scanning feature to streamline fuel transaction processing.",
              "challengesSolutions": "The project faced several key challenges, each addressed with tailored solutions. To increase taxi driver loyalty, a reward system was implemented, encouraging drivers to refuel at Sopetrole stations and redeem points at station shops. To detect fraudulent fuel transactions, Google Cloud Vision OCR was integrated for real-time verification, ensuring transaction authenticity. For real-time fuel sales insights, interactive dashboards using Power BI were developed, providing clear and actionable data. Lastly, to reduce transaction processing time for pompists, a QR code scanning feature was introduced, enabling quick and efficient data entry, minimizing manual workload, and enhancing overall operational efficiency."
